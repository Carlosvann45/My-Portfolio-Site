  ABOUT_ME_DESCRIPTION: 'Hello everyone! I am a full-stack software developer. Early in my career I gained certifications in aircraft avionics systems. It was there that my passion for software development was born. I realized that what the software could do was way more intriguing than maintaining the equipment. I happened to be lucky enough to have a wonderful mentor in my life - my grandfather who is an IT professional. I built simple programs with flutter, taking my first steps as a developer. Through his mentoring I developed a strong work ethic, a curious mind and a drive for being the best at whatever I wanted to do. I was studying Computer Science at Full Sail University finishing my degree and ready to take my next step (i.e. Experience!!). In searching for internships, I found my current company, Catalyte and pursued their training program. I loved the "hands on approach" and this along with the educational fundamentals have given me confidence in my skills and abilities. ',
  ABOUT_ME_DESCRIPTION2: 'I have been on both sides of the learning process now. As a student and later a TA, I led groups of associates through the highly technical curriculum which strengthened my technical skills as well as my communication and leadership skills. ',
  ABOUT_ME_DESCRIPTION3: 'This brings me to the present day, where I continue to grow and learn each day. I am a skilled professional in a number of languages, technologies, and frameworks, which you will find a list of down below. ',
